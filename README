README for SDL_perl-1.18

What's New in 1.18
	o much more OpenGL support and test programs
	o removed warnings w/ -Wall
	o FreeBSD support
	o Improved installation

Installation:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

The perl script Makefile.PL will attempt to search for 
the standard place you may have installed SDL and its
supplemental libraries. 

It is also highly recommended that before you install
SDLperl, that you install the latest GLU from SGI.
As of the writing of this section, Mesa only supports 1.2
while SGI supports 1.3.  Mesa's support should be sufficient
in most cases.  Older versions such as 1.1 will be limited
in the OpenGL support, and 1.0 may not even build.

I am always more than happy to take patches, bug reports, and
helpful suggestions.  It is feedback, both good and poor, that
keeps projects like this going.
