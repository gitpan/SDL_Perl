BUGS and Outstanding Issues 


Using SDL::TTFont::width function with UTF-8 encoded strings returns 
the width of the characters that make up the UTF-8 format and not what 
they represent.  The function for this appears to exist in SDL.xs: 

AV* TTFSizeUTF8 ( font, text )

However, this function crashes immediately when called with a valid 
font and [utf-8 encoded] string.
