README for SDL_Perl-2.1.2

What's New in 2.1.2:

SDL_Perl-2.1.2 is a bug patch release that fixed a number of memory
leaks in blitting code, handles glGet queries, and some Build fixes.
For full details check the CHANGELOG file.

Prerequisites:

SDL Perl recommends installing the following libraries available
from http://www.libsdl.org/ prior to installing:

	SDL-1.2.6
	smpeg-0.4.4
	SDL_image-1.2.2
	SDL_gfx-2.0.3
	SDL_mixer-1.2.5
	SDL_net-1.2.4
	SDL_ttf-2.0.5

Additionally the following Perl modules should be installed:

	Module-Build-0.22
	Test-Simple-0.47

Installation:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

The build process will use the new Module::Build facility
to autodetect and build SDL Perl for your platform.  If
the build fails please forward bugs to sdl-devel@perl.org.

Documentation:

Each module now includes its own documentation, and 
is accessible through perldoc.  Additional tutorials,
code, and tips can be found at the website:

	http://sdl.perl.org

Online documentation and tutorials are available through
perldoc module.  

Contributing:

Anyone wishing to contribute modules, sprite engines, documentation,
and anything else that others might find useful, please join
the mailing list:

	sdl-devel@perl.org

This is a mailing list for those interested in SDLperl development,
both as an applications developer, and as a core contributor.

I am always more than happy to take patches, bug reports, and
helpful suggestions.  It is feedback, both good and poor, that
keeps projects like this going.

Enjoy,
