README for SDL_perl-1.19

What's New in 1.19.0
	* Added SDL::GraphicTool and testgraphictool.pl
	* Added NetBSD support
	* Added a menu example program
	* ./configure library disable options
	* Fixed OpenGL support bugs for Debain
	* Optimized SDL::App::loop

Installation:

	./configure
	make
	make install

The perl script Makefile.PL will attempt to search for 
the standard place you may have installed SDL and its
supplemental libraries. You can disable individual libraries
using the command line switches.  For example you can
avoid compiling OpenGL and GLU support as follows:

	./configure -GL -GLU

It is highly recommended that before you install
SDLperl, that you install the latest GLU from SGI.
As of the writing of this section, Mesa only supports 1.2
while SGI supports 1.3.  Mesa's support should be sufficient
in most cases.  Older versions such as 1.1 will be limited
in the OpenGL support, and 1.0 may not even build.
For those in a win32 environment, the the os typically ships
with only OpenGL 1.1 support, with OpenGL 1.2/1.3 support
only provided by graphics cards OEMs.  It is hightly
recommended that you install the latest development headers.

I am always more than happy to take patches, bug reports, and
helpful suggestions.  It is feedback, both good and poor, that
keeps projects like this going.
