	The files in this directory provide some basic examples of
using this extension to perl.  They are of differing level of difficulty
and documentation.  Here is a brief overview of what they are:

	./Viewer.pl filename

This app opens a graphics file and displays its contents in a window. To
close the application, you may either use your window manager's close button,
or press the Escape key on your keyboard.  

	./CDplayer.pl

This app creates a graphical cd player from a simple "skin" (which in this case
is any image that is divided horizontally into 6 parts.)  By clicking the
various 'buttons', you can then play cd music.  Basically, it is a simple
GUI that shows how one can use the Cdrom.pm module to write a basic cdplayer.

	./Flicker.pl

This is a simple-minded "slideshow" style image viewer.  It will cycle through
all of the gifs, jpegs, and png files in the directory, displaying them
in the center of the screen.  Since we don't do any resizing, if the image
doesn't fit on the screen, parts of it will be cropped.  Resizing surfaces
is an exercise best left to C code.  Moving the mouse quits the viewer.
