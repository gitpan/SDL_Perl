README for SDL_perl-1.14

What's New in 1.14

	o OO API works with new low-level API
	o Preliminary low level support for SDL_ttf and SDL_net
	o A semi-complete backwards compatability layer for SDL::sdlpl

What was New in 1.13
	o low-level api changes to better reflect SDL's API in perl
	o Joysticks supported 
	o more complete SDL Init/Quit subsystems support
	o Fewer mandatory library dependencies
	o automatic detection and configuration for optional libraries

Installation:

As root (or using sudo on the last step).

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

This should install it to your /usr/local/lib/perl5/ tree.
The perl script Makefile.PL will attempt to search for 
the standard place you may have installed SDL and its
supplemental libraries.  I promise I will eventually provide
user specified config options in the next release, promise.

Developer Documentation and Stuff:

Documentation is pretty sparse in this release, and that is
because I'm in the process of rewriting it.  As the documentation
project moves along, I hope to post the updates to the website

	http://www.sdlperl.org/docs/

Stay tuned for future documentation.

Contributing:

Anyone wishing to contribute modules, sprite engines, and anything
else that others might find useful, please email me at

	dave@cthulhu-burger.org

I am always more than happy to take patches, bug reports, and
helpful suggestions.  It is feedback, both good and poor, that
keeps projects like this going.

Enjoy,
