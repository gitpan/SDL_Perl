I couldn't get the scripts to work at all, so I added const.pl and uses this
to generate the scripts. const.pl is also responsible for making the constant
exporting backwards-compatible to SDL_perl 1.x.

This directory contains a set of scripts for generating the
SDL::Constants and SDL::OpenGL::Constants modules.  They
work by using the C preprocessor and gcc to extract defined
values and enumerated field's numerical values and create
constant subroutines that are exported into the main namespace.

To add a new constant, simply add the name of the constant
to the *_words.txt file and run the applicable script.  
This will overwrite the lib/SDL/* file in question.
