README for SDL_Perl-2.2.1

What's New in 2.2.1:

SDL_Perl-2.2.1
Adds critical bug fixes in the following areas:
-SDL and Constants
-SFont and TTFont 
-SDL::Tutorial

Prerequisites:

SDL Perl recommends installing the following libraries available
from http://www.libsdl.org/ prior to installing:

	SDL-1.2.8
	smpeg-0.4.5
	SDL_image-1.2.4
	SDL_mixer-1.2.6
	SDL_sound-1.0.1
	SDL_net-1.2.5
	SDL_gfx-2.0.13
	SDL_ttf-2.0.7
	SDL_svg-1.1.9
	SDL_vnc-1.0.0

Additionally the following Perl modules should be installed:

	Module-Build-0.22
	Test-Simple-0.62

Installation:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build bundle	# MacOS X only!
	./Build install

Installation with Windows + MinGW:

	set SDL_INST_DIR=Absolute/Path/to/SDLdir
	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install


The build process will use the new Module::Build facility
to auto detect and build SDL Perl for your platform.  If
the build fails please forward bugs to sdl-devel@perl.org.

For MacOS X users there is a new experimental bundle, 
that is called SDLPerl.app.  You can use this bundle
to run perl scripts with a .spl extension, you know,
SDL Perl files.  We will work on brining this style 
launcher and an integrated development environment to
all platforms shortly.

Documentation:

Each module now includes its own documentation, and 
is accessible through perldoc.  Additional tutorials,
code, and tips can be found at the website:

	http://sdl.perl.org

Online documentation and tutorials are available through
perldoc module.  

Contributing:

Anyone wishing to contribute modules, sprite engines, documentation,
and anything else that others might find useful, please join
the mailing list:

	sdl-devel@perl.org

This is a mailing list for those interested in SDLperl development,
both as an applications developer, and as a core contributor.

I am always more than happy to take patches, bug reports, and
helpful suggestions.  It is feedback, both good and poor, that
keeps projects like this going.

Enjoy,

David J. Goehrig <dgoehrig@cpan.org>
