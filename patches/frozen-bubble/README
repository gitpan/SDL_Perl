README - Patches for frozen-bubble 0.9.2

This directory contains two patch files, one for fb.pl
and another for SDL_mixer_patched/mikmod/virtch_common.c

The first of these removes a workaround for a bug in the
1.12 and earlier code.

The second fixes a NULL pointer dereferencing error in
the mixer code.
