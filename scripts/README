README 

This directory contains a set of scripts for generating the
SDL::Constants and SDL::OpenGL::Constants modules.  They
work by using the C preprocessor and gcc to extract defined
values and enumerated field's numerical values and create
constant subroutines that are exported into the main namespace.

To add a new constant, simply add the name of the constant
to the *_words.txt file and run the applicable script.  
This will overwrite the lib/SDL/* file in question.
