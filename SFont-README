Usage:
    1. Load a font and place it in an SDL_Surface *. If your are using the 
    SDL_image library you can do this with Font=IMG_Load("filename");
    2. Initialize the font by using InitFont(surface *Font);
    3. Now you can use the font in you SDL program.
	-void PutString( SDL_Surface *Destination, int x, int y, char *text );
	    blits the string stored in 'text' to the Destination.
	-int TextWidth( char *text );
	    returns the width of the string in pixels.

FileFormat:
    The font file can be any type image file. The characters start with
    ASCII symbol #33. They are seperated by pink(255,0,255) lines at the top
    of the image. The space between these lines is the width of the caracter.
    Just take a look at the font, and you'll be able to understand what I tried
    to explain here.
    The easiest way to create a new font is to use the GIMP's Logo function.
    Use the following string as text (ASCII 33-127 with escape sequences and
    spaces between the letters):
    ! \" # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; < = > ? @ A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z [ \\ ] ^ _ ` a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z { | } ~

ChangeLog:
1.0
    Added the Input function
    Added a check wether the Font has been loaded
0.9
    better Makefile for the example (using sdl-config)
    better Neon Font
0.8 
    First Release
